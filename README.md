# Passing-Stones
Developed theorems and simulated scenarios based on the graph theory problem "Passing Stones"

This project was developed in collaboration with Peter Cheng, Vinit Ranjan, and Aaron Sartin.

## Problem Statement

Passing stones is a game played on the vertices of a graph. In Passing Stones, every vertex simultaneously passes one stone to each neighbor, given that it has enough stones to do so. The game itself is an important sub-problem of important combinatorial problems including the ùê¥-cordial graph problem.

## Our Findings

After spending weeks modeling different scenarios, our team was able to find and prove many interesting theorems related to Passing Stones.
